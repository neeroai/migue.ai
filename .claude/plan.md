# Plan: Create World-Class Implementation Specs for migue.ai

## Executive Summary

Create 10 comprehensive specification files in `specs/` that bridge the gap between high-level documentation in `docs/` and implementation-ready code. These specs will enable the 2-person team (ClaudeCode&OnlyMe) to build a WhatsApp AI assistant that is:
- Compliant with WhatsApp policy (business automation, NOT chatbot)
- Secure (HMAC validation, RLS, PII handling, LATAM privacy)
- Cost-transparent (track all AI/messaging costs)
- Production-ready (testing, monitoring, operations)

**Target**: 8-10 week implementation timeline with quality foundation
