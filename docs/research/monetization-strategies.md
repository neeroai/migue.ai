### 9.4 Strategic Recommendations

**Pricing**:
1. Launch with $0/$5/$12/$29 tiers (test and iterate)
2. Annual discounts (17% off, boost cash flow)
3. Regional pricing (consider Colombia for lower CAC)
4. Price increases (Year 3+): $6/$15/$35 after market establishment

**Conversion**:
1. Free tier limits designed to convert (50 messages, no voice)
2. 7-day Plus trial (taste premium features)
3. Upgrade prompts (soft → hard, based on usage)
4. Social proof (# of upgraded users, testimonials)

**Revenue Diversification**:
1. Phase 1: Consumer freemium (primary revenue)
2. Phase 2: Premium integrations (+$288K ARR at Year 1)
3. Phase 3: White-label API (+$240K ARR)
4. Phase 3: Industry templates (+$490K one-time)
5. Phase 3+: Enterprise contracts (+$1.2M ARR)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- If low conversion: Improve free tier value, adjust limits
- If high churn: Focus on retention (weekly summaries, engagement)
- If price resistance: Test lower tiers ($3/$8/$20), regional pricing
- If competitors match pricing: Differentiate on features (voice, LATAM Spanish)
