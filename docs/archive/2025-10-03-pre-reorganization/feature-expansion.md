# migue.ai Feature Expansion Ideas

## 1. Conversational UX Enhancements
- **Interactive List & Button Messages** (WhatsApp): surface appointment slots, task menus, or follow-up actions using `interactive.list` and `interactive.button`. Increases completion rates and keeps conversations structured. *Effort*: medium (build menu routers, state machine). *Risks*: need fallbacks for legacy clients.
- **Flows (WhatsApp Flow Builder API)**: design mini-forms for onboarding, document uploads, or troubleshooting. Can collect structured data without leaving WhatsApp. *Effort*: high (flow design + state persistence). *Benefits*: near-native app experience within CSW window.
- **Typing & Presence Orchestration**: already emitting typing; expand to send read receipts/context (“Estoy procesando tu factura…”) via templated messages when >30s. *Effort*: low-medium; needs product guardrails to avoid spam.

## 2. Automation & Task Execution
- **Smart Follow-ups**: schedule proactive check-ins using utility templates once a task is pending (e.g., “¿Confirmas la cita?”). Combine WhatsApp scheduled messages with Supabase cron. *Effort*: medium; requires cost monitoring.
- **Workflow Integrations**: connect to Google Tasks/Trello via OpenAI function-calling to read/write tasks. *Effort*: medium-high; error handling crucial.
- **Agent Handoffs**: integrate human escalation (e.g., send `interactive.button` -> “Hablar con humano”) and notify support via webhook/email.

## 3. Multimodal Intelligence (OpenAI)
- **Vision Support**: enable GPT-4o vision for image-based questions (receipts, whiteboards). Flow: upload via WhatsApp media → download → `responses.create` with `image_url`. *Effort*: medium; ensure PII scrubbing.
- **Audio Summaries**: beyond transcription, auto-summarize voice notes with topic tags. *Effort*: low (reuse Whisper output + GPT summary).
- **Document Q&A Sandbox**: allow ad-hoc question answering even without prior ingest using inline embeddings (stream compute, no persistence). Good for one-off docs.
- **Function Calling for Pro Services**: define structured functions (e.g., `book_service`, `check_invoice`) so GPT-4o can autonomously chain tasks. *Effort*: medium-high; requires safety rails and deterministic outputs.

## 4. Personalization & Context
- **User Profiles**: store preferences (language, time zone, notification window) and feed them into system prompts. *Effort*: low-medium; new columns + migration.
- **Adaptive Prompts**: track intent confusion and adjust instructions using OpenAI Prompt Caching (when available) for latency optimization.
- **Sentiment-Aware Replies**: detect tone via OpenAI classification to switch to empathetic responses or escalate faster.

## 5. Commerce & Monetization
- **Catalog & Cart Messages**: leverage WhatsApp catalog/product APIs to sell services (e.g., booking packages). *Effort*: medium-high; requires business verification and product sync.
- **Payments**: integrate Meta Pay (where available) or links to Stripe Checkout triggered by assistant. Must comply with WhatsApp policy and handle template approvals.

## 6. Analytics & Quality
- **Conversation Insights**: log intent distribution, latency, and success outcomes (calendar booked, reminder sent) to Supabase analytics tables. *Effort*: medium; helpful for retention KPIs.
- **A/B Prompt Testing**: store multiple prompt variants and rotate; evaluate success using conversion metrics. Proactively fine-tune to local Spanish dialects.
- **Feedback Loop**: send quick rating buttons after complex flows (“¿Te fue útil?”). Feed results back into prompt adjustments.

## 7. Reliability & Safety
- **Guardrail Functions**: implement content filters (OpenAI moderation) before sending responses to catch PII leakage or offensive content. *Effort*: low-medium.
- **Session Locking**: prevent overlapping automation (e.g., double booking) by using Supabase advisory locks or state machines.
- **Audit Trails**: log all external API actions (Google Calendar, Trello) with request IDs for compliance.

### Prioritization Hints
1. **Short Term (2–4 semanas)**: interactive messages, audio summary, user profiles, feedback loop.
2. **Mid Term (1–2 meses)**: flows, function calling with external integrations, catalog support.
3. **Long Term**: payments, advanced analytics suite, proactive marketing within compliance.

### Implementation Notes
- Coordinate template approvals early for proactive messages.
- Monitor OpenAI usage caps when enabling vision/function calling.
- Ensure `.bmad-core/` and RLS remain untouched; new tables should inherit policies.
